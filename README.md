# Midterm: BookShelf App
This project builds a BookShelf App using Fast API, Uvicorn, and Pydantic. The bookshelf initially displays the buttons to add and filter cards based on their reading status. The app allows a user to add, edit, and delete cards containing book information such as Title, Author, Genre, user's rating, and the user's reading status on the book. 

## Files

### Back End
```main.py``` , ```todo.py``` , ```todo_routes.py``` : Uses Fast API and python.

### Styling

### Data Models 
Data models used within the app included Pydantic for data validation.
