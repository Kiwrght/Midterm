# Midterm: BookShelf App
This project builds a BookShelf App using Fast API, Uvicorn, and Pydantic. The bookshelf initially displays the buttons to add and filter cards based on their reading status. The app allows a user to add, edit, and delete cards containing book information such as Title, Author, Genre, user's rating, and the user's reading status on the book.
